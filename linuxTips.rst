Linux Tips and Tricks
=====================

Packages Everyone Should Have
-----------------------------

- fortune-mod
    + Fortune draws from a huge database of quotes and displays one at random. It maybe insightful, it maybe a funny joke, or fortune may downright insult you. I do recomend adding a ``fortune -s`` to your ``.bashrc``
- cowsay
    + Make cows say whatever you like!
    + ``fortune | cowsay``
- screen
    + Screen creates a virtual terminal in the curent terminal. This is amazing for quick bash scripts or running multiple commands on a remote server.
- watch
    + Ever wanted to run the same command every X timeframe? Well now you can, combine with screen to create something easier than a cronjob.
    + ``watch "fortune | cowsay"``
- sl
    + acidentally type sl instead of ls, welp you now have a steam locamotive!
