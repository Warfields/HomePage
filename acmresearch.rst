Introduction
------------

Throughout the last year ACM has discovered a need for skilled software 
developers by Mines' various research projects. For example, ACM was contacted
by researchers in the environmental department about setting an automated
sensor recorder. By using our members expertise in electronics and software the
project which had been stalled for two weeks was finished within two hours.

The goal of the ACM research team ist to provide high quality resource to all
researchers on campus to speed up research projects. From data scientists to
hardware specialists ACM can provide the technical know how for your project.
ACM also takes out the hassle of finding new talent as we will sort though the
process of validating the technical know how of selected students

Project Classifications
-----------------------

1. Simple Projects (2 - 4 hours)
    - A Simple project is a small software or hardware that a student could finish
      in a short time. These are expected to introduce students to researchers and
      only have to have a well defined goal.
#. Large Software Projects
    - For larger projects requiring multiple developers over a several week
      period there are several options. 
        - If it is possible to have the final
          software delivery date after summer session one it is highly recommend to 
          have it be submitted as Computer Science Field Session project.
          Contact `Tracy Camp <tcamp@mines.edu>`_
        - Otherwise it can be submitted as an ACM open source project, and
          has to adhear to ACM's `internal project policies`__
#. Long Term IT Position
    - For long term project maintenance such Systems Administration and
      Database Management, and long term data analysis we can provide quality
      students to fill the job. For these types of position payment for 
      students is required to retain students for these positions. With current 
      Computer Science internships internships having a median pay of $20.60 
      per hour worked we highly recommend researchers considering to hire one of
      our members, to pay close this rate for long term retention.
