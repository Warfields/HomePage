Samuel Warfield
===============
Hello there! Seeing as you have found my home page you might want to
know what's here. Well this corner of the web contains everything I
that I wish I knew as a freshmen in Computer Science. These include
obscure services and `free stuff I found <https://education.github.com/pack>`_.

I highly suggest starting with :ref:`coolLinks` or :ref:`servers`.
